# Olympus
## Olympus does Computing and does not care about what Routine is being used, it only cares about where to run it and why.

### Whether your computing over network clusters, virtual machines, containers, interpreters, or whatever, Olympus provides the flow of your Moira Machine.
A Moira machine can therefore be a very complicated execution environment for optimizing specific purpose computation (Hardware Optimization).

#### In otherwords, whatever your computational needs are from an orchastrational perspective, Olympus takes care of it. Multicloud orchastration is an example of an Abstract Machine that takes input, computes, and gives a result.
